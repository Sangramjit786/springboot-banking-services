## ðŸ“– Detailed Documentation

### 1) How to build microservices  
We follow **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **bounded context** to split business functionality into small, independently deployable services (Accounts, Loans, Cards).

### 2) Introduction to SpringBoot framework  
Spring Boot simplifies microservice development by providing **auto-configuration**, **embedded server support (Tomcat/Jetty)**, and **production-ready features** like Actuator.

### 3) Introduction to REST APIs & best practices  
REST APIs are the backbone of microservices. We implement them with:  
- **Stateless design**  
- **Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)**  
- **Standard response codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)**  
- **Error handling with `@ControllerAdvice`**

### 4) Creating a Spring Boot project  
The project uses **Spring Initializr** to create services with dependencies like `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, and `springdoc-openapi`.

### 5) Creating Hello World REST API using @RestController  
A simple `@RestController` was built for testing service availability, returning `"Hello Banking Services!"`.

### 6) Configuring H2 DB & YAML properties  
The Accounts microservice uses **in-memory H2 DB** for quick testing, configured via `application.yaml` with schema and data initialization.

### 7) Writing Spring Data JPA entities & repositories to interact with DB tables  
Entities like **Accounts, Loans, Cards** map to DB tables. Repositories extend `JpaRepository` to provide CRUD operations.

### 8) Introduction to DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern  
DTOs are introduced to decouple **entity persistence models** from **API contracts**, improving security and maintainability.

### 9) Creating DTOs inside accounts microservice  
`AccountDTO` is created to transfer account details between layers without exposing the JPA entity directly.

### 10) CREATE API inside accounts microservice  
Implements **POST /accounts** endpoint to create a new account, mapping request DTO â†’ entity â†’ DB.

### 11) READ API inside accounts microservice  
Implements **GET /accounts/{id}** endpoint to fetch account details using JPA repository.

### 12) UPDATE API inside accounts microservice  
Implements **PUT /accounts/{id}** endpoint to update account details, leveraging DTO validation.

### 13) DELETE API inside accounts microservice  
Implements **DELETE /accounts/{id}** endpoint to remove accounts safely from DB.

### 14) Handle all types of runtime exceptions using global logic inside accounts  
Global error handling implemented with `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`.

### 15) Also implemented GlobalExceptionHandler. Implemented 'CustomMapper'  
- **GlobalExceptionHandler**: centralized runtime exception handling.  
- **CustomMapper**: utility to map entities â†” DTOs consistently.

### 16) Perform input data validations inside accounts microservice  
Used **Jakarta Bean Validation** (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`) with `@Valid` annotations to validate input DTOs.

### 17) Update audit columns using Spring Data  
`@CreatedDate`, `@LastModifiedDate` annotations update audit columns automatically.

### 18) Introduction to documentation of REST APIs using springdoc openapi  
**springdoc-openapi** integrated to auto-generate Swagger UI for REST APIs.

### 19) Enhancing documentation of REST APIs using @OpenAPIDefinition  
Applied at the class level for global metadata (title, version, description).

### 20) Enhancing documentation of REST APIs using @Tag, @Operation, @ApiResponse  
Used to group APIs and provide response documentation.

### 21) Enhancing documentation of REST APIs using @Schema & example data  
DTOs annotated with `@Schema` to show API request/response examples.

### 22) Important Annotations & Classes that supports building REST services  
Key annotations include `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@PathVariable`, `@RequestBody`, `@ResponseStatus`, etc.

### 23) Assignment to build Loans & Cards microservices  
Parallel microservices created with similar CRUD operations for **Loans** and **Cards**.

### 24) Deep dive and demo of Loans microservice  
Loans microservice supports APIs for loan creation, reading details, updating, and deletion.

### 25) Deep dive and demo of Cards microservice  
Cards microservice supports APIs for issuing cards, managing limits, and tracking status.

### 26) Approaches to identify boundaries & right size microservices  
Discussed **business capabilities**, **team ownership**, and **independent scaling** to size microservices properly.

### 27) Sizing & identifying boundaries with a Bank App use case  
Accounts, Loans, and Cards were identified as **separate bounded contexts** in the banking domain.

### 28) Sizing & identifying boundaries with an ecommerce migration use case  
Example: splitting ecommerce into **Orders, Payments, Inventory** microservices.

### 29) Strangler Fig pattern  
Adopted **Strangler Fig pattern** for gradually migrating monolithic banking systems into microservices.

### 30) Introduction to challenges while building, deploying microservices  
Challenges: **distributed data**, **network latency**, **service discovery**, **logging**, and **monitoring**.

### 31) What are Containers & how they are different from VMs  
Containers are **lightweight**, share OS kernel, and are faster than VMs.

### 32) Definition of Containers, Containerization, Docker  
Docker used for containerization to ensure consistency across environments.

### 33) Introduction to Docker components & its architecture  
Docker architecture explained: **Client â†’ Daemon â†’ Registry â†’ Images â†’ Containers**.

### 34) Docker installation & docker hub introduction  
Installed Docker Desktop, created account on **Docker Hub** for image storage.

### 35) Introduction to the three approaches for Docker image generation  
- **Dockerfile**  
- **Buildpacks**  
- **Google Jib**

### 36) Generate Docker Image of Accounts microservice with Dockerfile  
Custom Dockerfile created for `accounts-service`.

### 37) Running accounts microservice as a Docker container  
Executed `docker run` to start container with mapped port.

### 38) Challenges with Dockerfile approach to generate a Docker image  
Manual maintenance, dependency mismatches, and verbose configuration.

### 39) Generate Docker Image of Loans microservice with Buildpacks  
Built image with **Spring Boot Buildpacks** (`./mvnw spring-boot:build-image`).

### 40) Generate Docker Image of Cards microservice with Google Jib  
Generated image using **Google Jib Maven plugin**.

### 41) Compare Dockerfile, Buildpacks, Jib approaches  
- **Dockerfile**: Full control, more effort.  
- **Buildpacks**: Zero Docker knowledge required.  
- **Jib**: Fast, no Docker daemon dependency.

### 42) Pushing Docker images from your local to remote Docker hub repository  
`docker push username/repo:tag` used to publish images.

### 43) Introduction to Docker Compose  
Docker Compose used to orchestrate multiple containers.

### 44) Running all microservice containers using Docker Compose command  
Defined all services in `docker-compose.yml` and ran with `docker-compose up`.

### 45) Demo of docker compose commands  
Commands like `docker-compose ps`, `logs`, `down` were demonstrated.

### 46) Deep dive on Docker commands

### 107) Challenges while dealing external communication in microservices
External communication introduces challenges such as latency, network failures, security risks, and version mismatches. These issues must be addressed with resiliency patterns, retries, circuit breakers, and API gateways.

### 108) Why we need an Edge Server or API Gateway inside microservices
An API Gateway acts as the single entry point to microservices, handling routing, security, load balancing, logging, and cross-cutting concerns, thus reducing client-side complexity.

### 109) Introduction to Spring Cloud Gateway
Spring Cloud Gateway is a reactive, non-blocking API Gateway built on Spring WebFlux, providing dynamic routing, filters, rate limiting, and resiliency features.

### 110) Deep dive on Spring Cloud Gateway internal architecture
Spring Cloud Gateway uses RouteDefinitionLocator (for routes), Predicate (to match requests), and Filters (to apply modifications). It is built on Project Reactor for high-performance reactive handling.

### 111) Building Edge Server using Spring Cloud Gateway
We build an Edge Server by creating a Spring Boot project with spring-cloud-starter-gateway. It routes incoming requests to backend services using route definitions.

### 112) Demo of Edge Server with default routing configs
A demo shows configuring routes in application.yml with service URLs and testing them using Postman or browser requests.

### 113) Make changes inside Gateway server to accept service names with lower case
Spring Cloud Gateway is case-sensitive by default. We configure it to handle lowercase service names to ensure consistency and usability.

### 114) Implementing Custom Routing using Spring Cloud Gateway
Custom routing is implemented using Java-based configuration (RouteLocatorBuilder) to apply dynamic routing logic.

### 115) Demo of addResponseHeader filter
We demonstrate adding custom headers (e.g., X-Service-Name, X-Trace-Id) using Gatewayâ€™s addResponseHeader filter for better tracking.

### 116) Implementing Cross-cutting concerns Tracing & Logging using Gateway
We add filters to capture request/response logs and trace IDs at the Gateway level for centralized tracing.

### 117) Design patterns around API Gateway
Common patterns include:
Aggregator Pattern: Combining multiple microservice calls.
Backend-for-Frontend (BFF): Different gateways for different clients.
Edge Security Pattern: Centralizing authentication/authorization.

### 118) Generating and pushing Docker images with Spring Cloud Gateway changes
We add a Dockerfile, build images with docker build, and push them to Docker Hub for deployment.

### 119) Updating Docker Compose file to adapt Spring Cloud Gateway changes
We update docker-compose.yml to include the new Gateway service with networking and dependencies.

### 120) Introduction to the need of Resiliency inside microservices
Resiliency ensures microservices continue functioning under failures. It protects against network issues, latency, or service crashes.

### 121) Typical use case or scenario for the need of Resiliency
Example: If Loan Service is down, Accounts should still work by returning cached or fallback responses.

### 122) Deep dive on Circuit Breaker pattern
Circuit Breaker prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service and restoring when it becomes healthy.

### 123) Three states of Circuit Breaker pattern
Closed â†’ Requests flow normally.
Open â†’ Requests blocked due to failures.
Half-Open â†’ Limited requests allowed to test recovery.

### 124) Implementing Circuit Breaker pattern in Gateway
Using Resilience4j, we configure circuit breakers inside Spring Cloud Gateway for failing routes.

### 125) Implementing Fallback mechanism for Circuit Breaker pattern in APIGateway service/Edge server
When a service fails, the Gateway returns a default fallback response instead of propagating the error.

### 126) Implementing Circuit Breaker pattern with Feign Client
Feign Clients integrate with Resilience4j/Hystrix to provide circuit breaking and fallbacks for REST calls.

### 127) Implementing Http timeout configurations, in loans service
We configure connect/read timeouts in application.yml to avoid infinite waits during service calls.

### 128) Introduction to Retry pattern
Retry re-executes failed requests (with exponential backoff) to handle temporary failures.

### 129) Implementing Retry pattern in Gateway
We configure Retry filters in Gateway to automatically retry failed requests.

### 130) Implementing Retry pattern in accounts
Accounts service is configured with Resilience4j Retry to handle intermittent downstream failures.

### 131) Introduction to Rate Limiter pattern
Rate Limiting ensures fair usage by restricting request rates per client/service.

### 132) Introduction to Redis RateLimiter in Gateway Server
Spring Cloud Gateway integrates with Redis for distributed rate limiting across multiple instances.

### 133) Implementing Redis RateLimiter in Gateway Server
We configure RedisRateLimiter in Gateway application.yml to throttle requests.

### 134) Implementing Redis RateLimiter in Gateway Server and tested using Apache Benchmark
We run ab tool to simulate high traffic and validate request throttling.

### 135) Implementing RateLimiter pattern in accounts
Rate limiting is added at the service level to protect accounts API from abuse.

### 136) Introduction to Bulkhead pattern
Bulkheads isolate resources (like thread pools) for services to contain failures.

### 137) Aspect order of Resiliency patterns
Order: Timeout â†’ Retry â†’ Circuit Breaker â†’ Bulkhead â†’ Fallback.

### 138) Demo of Resiliency patterns using Docker containers & Docker compose
We test resiliency (circuit breakers, retries, bulkheads) in a Dockerized microservice setup.
