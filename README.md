## ðŸ“– Detailed Documentation

### 1) How to build microservices  
We follow **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **bounded context** to split business functionality into small, independently deployable services (Accounts, Loans, Cards).

### 2) Introduction to SpringBoot framework  
Spring Boot simplifies microservice development by providing **auto-configuration**, **embedded server support (Tomcat/Jetty)**, and **production-ready features** like Actuator.

### 3) Introduction to REST APIs & best practices  
REST APIs are the backbone of microservices. We implement them with:  
- **Stateless design**  
- **Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)**  
- **Standard response codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)**  
- **Error handling with `@ControllerAdvice`**

### 4) Creating a Spring Boot project  
The project uses **Spring Initializr** to create services with dependencies like `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, and `springdoc-openapi`.

### 5) Creating Hello World REST API using @RestController  
A simple `@RestController` was built for testing service availability, returning `"Hello Banking Services!"`.

### 6) Configuring H2 DB & YAML properties  
The Accounts microservice uses **in-memory H2 DB** for quick testing, configured via `application.yaml` with schema and data initialization.

### 7) Writing Spring Data JPA entities & repositories to interact with DB tables  
Entities like **Accounts, Loans, Cards** map to DB tables. Repositories extend `JpaRepository` to provide CRUD operations.

### 8) Introduction to DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern  
DTOs are introduced to decouple **entity persistence models** from **API contracts**, improving security and maintainability.

### 9) Creating DTOs inside accounts microservice  
`AccountDTO` is created to transfer account details between layers without exposing the JPA entity directly.

### 10) CREATE API inside accounts microservice  
Implements **POST /accounts** endpoint to create a new account, mapping request DTO â†’ entity â†’ DB.

### 11) READ API inside accounts microservice  
Implements **GET /accounts/{id}** endpoint to fetch account details using JPA repository.

### 12) UPDATE API inside accounts microservice  
Implements **PUT /accounts/{id}** endpoint to update account details, leveraging DTO validation.

### 13) DELETE API inside accounts microservice  
Implements **DELETE /accounts/{id}** endpoint to remove accounts safely from DB.

### 14) Handle all types of runtime exceptions using global logic inside accounts  
Global error handling implemented with `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`.

### 15) Also implemented GlobalExceptionHandler. Implemented 'CustomMapper'  
- **GlobalExceptionHandler**: centralized runtime exception handling.  
- **CustomMapper**: utility to map entities â†” DTOs consistently.

### 16) Perform input data validations inside accounts microservice  
Used **Jakarta Bean Validation** (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`) with `@Valid` annotations to validate input DTOs.

### 17) Update audit columns using Spring Data  
`@CreatedDate`, `@LastModifiedDate` annotations update audit columns automatically.

### 18) Introduction to documentation of REST APIs using springdoc openapi  
**springdoc-openapi** integrated to auto-generate Swagger UI for REST APIs.

### 19) Enhancing documentation of REST APIs using @OpenAPIDefinition  
Applied at the class level for global metadata (title, version, description).

### 20) Enhancing documentation of REST APIs using @Tag, @Operation, @ApiResponse  
Used to group APIs and provide response documentation.

### 21) Enhancing documentation of REST APIs using @Schema & example data  
DTOs annotated with `@Schema` to show API request/response examples.

### 22) Important Annotations & Classes that supports building REST services  
Key annotations include `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@PathVariable`, `@RequestBody`, `@ResponseStatus`, etc.
