# Spring Boot Banking Services â€“ Microservices Project

GitHub Repository: [springboot-banking-services](https://github.com/Sangramjit786/springboot-banking-services.git)

This repository demonstrates how to design, develop, and deploy cloud-native microservices using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud**, **Docker**, **Eureka**, and other modern frameworks.  
The project simulates a **banking application** with **Accounts, Loans, and Cards** microservices, covering best practices in REST APIs, service discovery, configuration management, resilience, and deployment.

## ðŸ“– Detailed Documentation

### 1) How to build microservices  
We follow **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **bounded context** to split business functionality into small, independently deployable services (Accounts, Loans, Cards).

### 2) Introduction to SpringBoot framework  
Spring Boot simplifies microservice development by providing **auto-configuration**, **embedded server support (Tomcat/Jetty)**, and **production-ready features** like Actuator.

### 3) Introduction to REST APIs & best practices  
REST APIs are the backbone of microservices. We implement them with:  
- **Stateless design**  
- **Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)**  
- **Standard response codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)**  
- **Error handling with `@ControllerAdvice`**

### 4) Creating a Spring Boot project  
The project uses **Spring Initializr** to create services with dependencies like `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, and `springdoc-openapi`.

### 5) Creating Hello World REST API using @RestController  
A simple `@RestController` was built for testing service availability, returning `"Hello Banking Services!"`.

### 6) Configuring H2 DB & YAML properties  
The Accounts microservice uses **in-memory H2 DB** for quick testing, configured via `application.yaml` with schema and data initialization.

### 7) Writing Spring Data JPA entities & repositories to interact with DB tables  
Entities like **Accounts, Loans, Cards** map to DB tables. Repositories extend `JpaRepository` to provide CRUD operations.

### 8) Introduction to DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern  
DTOs are introduced to decouple **entity persistence models** from **API contracts**, improving security and maintainability.

### 9) Creating DTOs inside accounts microservice  
`AccountDTO` is created to transfer account details between layers without exposing the JPA entity directly.

### 10) CREATE API inside accounts microservice  
Implements **POST /accounts** endpoint to create a new account, mapping request DTO â†’ entity â†’ DB.

### 11) READ API inside accounts microservice

### 108) Why we need an Edge Server or API Gateway inside microservices
An API Gateway acts as the single entry point to microservices, handling routing, security, load balancing, logging, and cross-cutting concerns, thus reducing client-side complexity.

helm uninstall accounts

### 226) Quick revision of important helm commands
helm install â†’ deploy chart.
helm upgrade â†’ upgrade release.
helm rollback â†’ rollback release.
helm uninstall â†’ remove release.
helm history â†’ view version history.
helm template â†’ preview manifests.

### 227) Introduction to Server-side service discovery and load balancing
Kubernetes handles service discovery internally using DNS-based discovery and load balancing using ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer services.

### 228) How to setup discovery server in K8s cluster using Spring Cloud Kubernetes
Spring Cloud Kubernetes allows microservices to auto-discover each other using ConfigMaps and Kubernetes Services, avoiding Eureka when inside K8s.

### 229) Install spring cloud kubernetes discovery server in K8s cluster
Discovery server Helm chart deployed with:
helm install discovery ./discovery-chart

### 230) Making Kubernetes Discovery Client changes in microservices
Update pom.xml:
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client-all</artifactId>
</dependency>
Enable via bootstrap.yaml.

### 231) Updating Helm charts for Kubernetes Discovery Server changes
Modify service Helm charts to remove Eureka configs and rely on Kubernetes DNS discovery.

### 232) Demo of Server-side service discovery and load balancing
Deploy services and validate:
kubectl get svc
Access services by DNS: http://accounts.default.svc.cluster.local.

### 233) Kubernetes support by Cloud providers
GCP: GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine).
AWS: EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).
Azure: AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service).
These offer managed K8s clusters with auto-scaling, security, monitoring.

### 234) Set up Google Cloud account & install Google Cloud SDK
Create free GCP account.
Install SDK:
gcloud init

### 235) Create a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud
gcloud container clusters create eazybank-cluster --zone=us-central1-a

### 236) Installing all our microservices and supporting components in Google Cloud K8s
Use Helm to install all services:
helm install accounts ./accounts-chart --namespace eazybank
helm install keycloak ./keycloak-chart

### 237) Demo of eazybank microservices using Google Cloud Kubernetes Cluster
Access services via LoadBalancer IPs.
Validate that Accounts, Loans, and Cards microservices interact seamlessly.

### 238) Validate Grafana components in Google Cloud Kubernetes Cluster
Check dashboards for metrics, logs, and tracing inside GCP-managed Grafana.

### 239) Deleting the Google Cloud Kubernetes Cluster
gcloud container clusters delete eazybank-cluster --zone=us-central1-a

### 240) Quick introduction to Kubernetes Ingress
Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that manages external access (HTTP/HTTPS) to services inside the cluster.

### 241) Deep dive on Kubernetes Ingress & Ingress Controller
Ingress Resource â†’ defines rules for routing traffic.
Ingress Controller (e.g., Nginx) â†’ enforces rules and provides SSL termination.

### 242) Benefits of Kubernetes Ingress & the kind of traffic it handles
Consolidates routing in one place.
Supports SSL/TLS termination.
Handles HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
Reduces need for multiple LoadBalancers.

### 243) Introduction to Service Mesh & it's capabilities
Service Mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) adds observability, traffic control, retries, circuit breaking, mTLS between microservices.

### 244) Introduction to Service mesh components
Data Plane â†’ sidecar proxies (Envoy).
Control Plane â†’ manages policies, configurations, and observability.

### 245) Introduction to mTLS & deep dive on how TLS works
TLS encrypts communication between client and server. mTLS (mutual TLS) ensures both client and server authenticate each other, increasing security.

### 246) How does mTLS works
Client requests connection â†’ sends certificate.
Server validates client cert.
Server sends its certificate â†’ client validates.
Secure encrypted channel established.

### 247) Optimizing Microservices Development with Spring Boot BOM
BOM (Bill of Materials) manages common dependencies.
Ensures consistency across microservices without version conflicts.
Example:
<dependencyManagement>
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
     <version>3.2.0</version>
     <type>pom</type>
     <scope>import</scope>
   </dependency>
</dependencyManagement>

### 248) Shared Libraries in Microservices
We create shared libraries for common code (DTOs, exception handling, utilities).
Reduces duplication.
Speeds up development.
Ensures consistency across services.
